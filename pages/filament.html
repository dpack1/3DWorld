        <p>Once you get your hands on your first 3d printer there is an abundance of 3D printer material that is available to you. But what are the different types of 3D printer filament? When should you use them?</p>
        <p>Below, we cover all of the everyday 3D printer filaments, such as <code>PLA</code> and <code>PETG</code>, plus the tougher engineering-grade materials and the fancy stuff that lets you get creative (frequently referred to as exotics). In addition to the likes of <code>nylon, polycarbonate, carbon fiber reinforced,</code> and <code>polypropylene</code>, there are also special blends with unusual properties like electrical conductivity and luminescence.</p>
        <h2><code>PLA</code></h2>
        <p>PLA is short for Polylactic Acid, a thermoplastic polymer that is derived from renewable resources, more specifically from corn starch or sugar cane. But inside of the FDM 3D printing sphere, PLA filament is widely thought of as an aesthetic material best used for prototyping.</p>

        <p>PLA is the most popular material used in FDM 3D printing. It’s easy to use, safe, affordable, and it has outstanding material properties. You can use PLA filament for a wide range of applications and it comes in an equally diverse range of composites and colors</p>

        <p>With such a wide variety of PLA on the market, it can be tough to discern which filaments are created by reliable manufacturers and are high in quality. At the end of the day, you don’t want the cheapest filament if it means it’ll give you lousy print results, but you also don’t want to buy the most expensive filament when a cheaper one would have been just as good.</p>

        <h2><code>PETG</code> </h2>

        <p>PETG is made from Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), the material you know from plastic water bottles, and enhanced with glycol (hence the letter G after PET). The glycol is added to the material composition during polymerization. The result is a filament that is clearer, less brittle, and easier to use than its base form of PET. However, it does have the unfortunate side effect of changing the recycling process. Don’t mix PETG in with regular PET — the glycol is a troublesome contaminant to recycling facilities.</p>
